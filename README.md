## Compilers tested

- icpc version 2021.2.0 (gcc version 9.2.0 compatibility)
- gcc version 9.2.0 (GCC)

## How to build

Run `make` from current folder:

    make

## How to run

You can use `main` executable to run CSeg from command line.
We are using PIGO for parallel input, and currently support `mtx` inputs only.

Use `main -h` to see all options. An usage example, multiplying the matrices in ./exampleData

```shell
./main -A ./exampleData/gre_185_left.mtx -B ./exampleData/gre_185_right.mtx -t -w 1 -e 2
-> Loading inputs.
-> Matrix A at ./exampleData/gre_185_left.mtx statistics

                        Num of non-zeros :       1005
                              Max degree :          7
